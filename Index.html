<h1>Maharashtra Spices</h1>
<p>where you get <b>Authentic original taste</b> </p>
<main>
    <p>Maharashtra Spices was founded back in 1990 when an ordinary housewife (Nita) realized her delicious food secret is actually her home-made masalas. From childhood she wanted to do something unique which skills she has. And then later she established her own home-made Maharashtra spices products. She opened up a small shop called Maharashtra Spices and began selling high quality spices from India to almost each part of world.
        Maharashtra Spices soon grew in stature and acceptability. From a household name amongst Maharashtrian families to a firm favourite of Asian home cooks in the UK, today Maharashtra Spices has become a brand much loved by many. And our ambition to bring you the authentic taste of home stands stronger than ever before.

    <h3>SPICE SOURCING </h3>
    <p>At the heart of our business is a quest to unearth the most authentic high-quality spices. We travel deep into the heartland, where spices are found in their purest form. They are then sown and grown. The journey of spices from seed to shelf takes place under the watchful eye of experts and local farmers.
        Each Maharashtra spice is carefully grown in the most ideal conditions. They are handpicked and harvested at just the right moment by practiced hands.
        Dried, cleaned, crushed, grounded, and sorted, each spice goes through a unique process most suited to them. Then the spices are tested by accredited food testing laboratories in India and around the world to ensure they are safe for consumption and ready to eat even when they aren’t cooked. Once the spices meet the strict quality standards, they are packQd and placed on the shelf.
        So you can be rest assured that only the finest and purest of spices reach your masaledani (spice box) to recreate the taste of home.
